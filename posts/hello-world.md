description: First post on the new site. Why I'm starting a blog and what I plan to write about.
---

This is my first post.

I've been meaning to start writing for a while. Not because I think I have all the answers, but because writing forces you to think clearly — and I could use more of that.

## What I'll write about

Mostly things I find interesting:

- **Technology** — tools, products, and ideas that change how we work
- **Building things** — lessons from making stuff, shipping it, and seeing what happens
- **Thinking clearly** — frameworks, mental models, and the occasional book review

## Why a blog

There's something about a personal site that feels right. No algorithm deciding who sees what. No character limits. Just ideas, written down, available to anyone who finds them.

So here we are. Let's see where this goes.
