title: Deep Work Changed Everything

description: How I restructured my days around focused sessions and why most productivity advice misses the point entirely.

I used to think being busy meant being productive. Twelve-hour days, constant context switching, inbox at zero. I wore it like a badge.

Then I read Cal Newport's *Deep Work* and realized I'd been optimizing for the wrong thing.

## The problem with shallow work

Most of what fills our days is shallow. Emails, messages, meetings, quick tasks. They feel productive because they're tangible — you can see the replies sent, the boxes checked. But they don't move you forward on anything that matters.

The work that actually creates value — writing, coding, designing, thinking — requires uninterrupted focus. And that's exactly what modern work is designed to destroy.

## What I changed

I started blocking off mornings. No meetings before noon. Phone on silent. Notifications off. Just me and the thing I'm working on.

The first week was brutal. My brain kept reaching for distractions like a phantom limb. But by week two, something shifted:

1. **I started finishing things.** Not starting five projects — finishing one.
2. **The quality went up.** When you can hold a whole problem in your head, the solutions are better.
3. **I actually had more free time.** Four focused hours produced more than eight distracted ones.

## The timer trick

I built myself a simple timer. Not a Pomodoro timer — I find 25 minutes too short for real depth. Just a visual countdown that fills up as I work. No numbers to stare at, no pressure. Just a quiet reminder that time is passing and I'm using it well.

Something about seeing the time accumulate — rather than counting down — changes how it feels. It's not a deadline. It's evidence.

## The hard part

The hard part isn't the technique. It's protecting the time. Everyone wants a piece of your attention. Your inbox, your team, your phone. Saying no to all of that, repeatedly, every single day — that's the real skill.

Deep work isn't about being antisocial or unavailable. It's about being intentional. Choosing when to be reachable and when to disappear into the work.

## Start small

If you're used to constant connectivity, don't try to go cold turkey. Start with one hour. One focused hour where you do nothing but the most important thing on your list. No phone, no email, no "just quickly checking."

You'll be surprised what one hour can produce.
