title: Why I Build

There's a moment when you go from using things to wondering how they work. And then another moment when you go from wondering to actually building.

I don't remember exactly when the switch flipped for me, but once it did, it never went back.

## The gap between ideas and execution

Everyone has ideas. The shower is full of them. But the distance between "wouldn't it be cool if..." and something that actually exists in the world is enormous. It's not a knowledge gap — it's a doing gap.

The first thing I ever built was terrible. But it existed. It was real. You could touch it, use it, break it. And that feeling — of making something from nothing — is what keeps me going.

## What building teaches you

When you build things, you learn differently than when you read about them:

- **You learn what matters.** Theory tells you everything is important. Practice shows you what actually moves the needle.
- **You learn to ship.** Perfectionism is the enemy. The best version is the one that exists.
- **You learn to iterate.** Version one is never the final version. The feedback loop is the product.

## The compounding effect

Every project teaches you something that makes the next one better. Not just technical skills — but judgment. Knowing what to build, what to skip, and when to pivot.

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it." — Alan Kay

That quote gets thrown around a lot, but it's true in a very literal sense. When you build, you're not waiting for the future to happen to you. You're making it.

## Keep going

The world needs more builders. Not just in tech — in everything. People who see problems and think "I could fix that" instead of "someone should fix that."

If you're reading this and you've been thinking about building something — start. Today. It doesn't have to be good. It just has to exist.
